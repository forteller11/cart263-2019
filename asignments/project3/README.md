Instructions:
wasd to move (kinda buggy)
arrow keys to look around (very buggy)

Description:
This program loads .obj files (only works if all faces are made up of 3 vertices)
gives each face a random colour, randomizes position velocity and rotation,
then displays them on screen using projection/translation/rotation/scale matrices.

hopfully with some more thoughtful meshes, placement of objects and sound it could create
for an interesting experience.
